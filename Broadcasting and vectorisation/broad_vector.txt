 what is broadcasting ?

 Broadcasting in Python (specifically in NumPy) is a powerful feature that allows arrays of different shapes to be used together in arithmetic operations without explicitly reshaping or copying data.


# 1 --> matching dmension = match hoga to addn and multiplication aaam se hoga
# 2 --> expanding single elements 
# 3 --> Incompatible shapes ke sath koi operation perform nahi hogi\


If two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the smaller one is padded with ones on the left.

Dimensions are compatible if:

They are equal, or

One of them is 1

Arrays are broadcast to a common shape by "stretching" the 1-sized dimensions.
